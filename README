LocalTunnel
===========

This is the vision:

		$ localtunnel 8080
		http://d8w72a.localtunnel.com is now forwarding to your local port 8080...

Wouldn't that be magical? Compare to http://novas007.livejournal.com/42971.html

Currently the focus is the forwarding plumbing. Works, but not so great with many concurrent requests.

It should probably be modeled more after this:
http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/browser/tags/releases/twisted-8.1.0/twisted/conch/ssh/forwarding.py

To try it out:

1) Start the server.
			python server.py
			
2) Point the client at a local port serving HTTP. 
			python client.py 8080
			
3) Use curl to request a page from your HTTP through the server.
			curl http://localhost:8999/
			
Browsers work, but it will choke trying to serve up all your assets.
