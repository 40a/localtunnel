LocalTunnel
===========

This is the vision:

		$ localtunnel 8080
		http://d8w72a.localtunnel.com is now forwarding to your local port 8080...

Wouldn't that be magical? Compare to http://novas007.livejournal.com/42971.html


To try it out:

1) Start the server.
			python server.py
			
2) Point the client at a local port serving HTTP. 
			python client.py 8080
			
3) Use curl to request a page. 
			curl http://localhost:8999
