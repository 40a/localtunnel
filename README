localtunnel -- instant reverse tunnel for local web servers

Dependencies: Ruby (with libopenssl) and Rubygems

Install: sudo gem install localtunnel

Usage: localtunnel [options] <localport>
  -k, --key FILE    upload a public key for authentication

localtunnel is a client to a free and open source reverse tunneling service 
made specifically for web traffic. It's intended to be used to temporarily 
expose local web servers to the greater Internet for debugging, unit tests, 
demos, etc. 

Using localtunnel is comparable to using SSH reverse/remote port forwarding on 
a remote host that has GatewayPorts enabled, but without all the configuration
or the need of a host. The localtunnel command works with a server component
that is running on localtunnel.com, which is provided as a free service.

You typically run it like this:

  $ localtunnel 8080
  
However, if you haven't run the command before, you'll need to upload a public
key to authenticate. You do this like so:

  $ localtunnel -k ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub 8080

After that, you shouldn't have to use -k again.

The tunnel remains open for as long as the command is running. The tunnel is 
closed if the command exists.
